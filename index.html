                        <p>
                            The software development lifecycle is a structured
                            approach to software development that focuses on
                            identifying, developing, testing, and delivering
                            software products. It is a critical framework for
                            understanding the various stages of the software
                            development process and the key responsibilities of
                            various stakeholders involved. In this technical
                            documentation, we will explore the key stages of the
                            software development lifecycle and the tools and
                            activities associated with each stage. Let's dive
                            in!

                            determining the project goals. It is the foundation
                            of the software development process and sets the
                            direction for the entire project.

                            Designing and prototyping are crucial stages in
                            software development to ensure that the final

                            create visual representations of the product, while
                            prototyping tools help test the functionality and
                            usability of the design. These stages help identify
                            any design flaws early in the development process
                            and save time and resources in the long run.

                            bugs and issues. This stage is where the project
                            comes to life and starts to take shape. It is
                            essential to write clean, maintainable code and
                            follow best practices to ensure the quality and
                            scalability of the application.
